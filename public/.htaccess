# --- Prevent Direct Access to Files ---
# Block access to .env, composer.json, etc. if they were accidentally placed in public
# (They should be in the project root, one level above public/)
RewriteRule ^(\.env|composer\.json|composer\.lock)$ - [F,L]

# --- Standard Front Controller Pattern ---
# Redirect all requests for files or directories that don't actually exist
# to the index.php script.

# If the request is not for an existing file
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f
# And the request is not for an existing directory
RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
# Then rewrite the request to index.php, appending the original request URI
# The QSA (Query String Append) flag ensures that any query parameters are preserved.
RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?url=$1 [L,QSA]

# --- Optional: Force HTTPS (Uncomment if your site uses SSL) ---
# RewriteCond %{HTTPS} off
# RewriteRule ^(.*)$ https://%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [L,R=301]

# --- Optional: Remove trailing slash from URLs (for SEO consistency) ---
# RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d
# RewriteRule ^(.*)/$ /$1 [L,R=301]

# --- PHP Settings (if needed and allowed by your host) ---
# For example, to increase memory limit or execution time:
# php_value memory_limit 256M
# php_value max_execution_time 60

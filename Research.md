It's interesting that you're looking for a "blog suite builder" on GitHub. The term "builder" can sometimes imply a tool that helps you construct the software itself (like a framework or a code generator), or it might refer to a user-facing tool within an existing platform that allows customization.

Based on your initial request (PHP, registration, email confirmation, individual user blogs), you're essentially looking for a **multi-user PHP blogging platform or a robust blog engine** that you can either use out-of-the-box or build upon.

Here's what I found on GitHub and some recommendations:

**Direct "Builders" vs. Full Platforms/Engines:**

* It's less common to find a "builder" in the sense of a tool that generates all the PHP code for a custom blog suite from scratch based on specifications.
* What you're more likely to find are existing open-source **blogging platforms, CMSs (Content Management Systems) with strong blogging features, or well-structured PHP projects** that provide the core functionality you need.

**Relevant GitHub Projects & Categories:**

Based on my search, here are some types of projects you'll encounter and some specific examples (though activity and feature sets can vary widely):

1.  **Multi-User Blogging Platforms (PHP & MySQL/MariaDB based):**
    * These are designed from the ground up to support multiple authors, each with their own space.
    * **`mindsparkist/Php-Mysql-FullStack---Multi-User-Blogging-Platform-with-SEO-`**:
        * **Features mentioned:** Multi-user functionality, individual profiles, CRUD for posts, commenting, SEO considerations.
        * **Link:** [https://github.com/mindsparkist/Php-Mysql-FullStack---Multi-User-Blogging-Platform-with-SEO-](https://github.com/mindsparkist/Php-Mysql-FullStack---Multi-User-Blogging-Platform-with-SEO-)
        * **Note:** This appears to be a full-stack project. Assess its activity and community if you consider using it.
    * **`KapilTamang/multi-user-blogging-system`**:
        * **Features mentioned:** Laravel-based, multi-user, post creation, comments, OAuth. Email verification is mentioned, which is a good sign for your email confirmation requirement.
        * **Link:** [https://github.com/KapilTamang/multi-user-blogging-system](https://github.com/KapilTamang/multi-user-blogging-system)
        * **Note:** Being Laravel-based means it uses a robust PHP framework, which can be a big advantage for structure and security.
    * **`Tarunno/Blog-PHP`**:
        * **Features mentioned:** Procedural PHP, multiple authors, personal profiles, admin panel.
        * **Link:** [https://github.com/Tarunno/Blog-PHP](https://github.com/Tarunno/Blog-PHP)
        * **Note:** This might be a simpler, more direct PHP implementation if you're not looking to dive into a framework like Laravel immediately.
    * **`Huzaifa-Asif/PHP-blogging-site-and-admin-panel-for-blog-insertion-and-user-management`**:
        * **Features mentioned:** Dynamic blog, admin panel for blog and user management.
        * **Link:** [https://github.com/Huzaifa-Asif/PHP-blogging-site-and-admin-panel-for-blog-insertion-and-user-management](https://github.com/Huzaifa-Asif/PHP-blogging-site-and-admin-panel-for-blog-insertion-and-user-management)

2.  **General Purpose PHP Blog Engines/CMS:**
    * Many of these can be configured or extended for multi-user blogging.
    * **Typecho (`typecho/typecho`)**:
        * **Features:** Simple, powerful, Markdown support, plugins, themes. While not explicitly a "multi-user first" platform in the same vein as some others, its extensibility might allow for this. It's a well-regarded PHP blogging platform.
        * **Link:** [https://github.com/typecho/typecho](https://github.com/typecho/typecho)
    * **HTMLy (`danpros/htmly`)**:
        * **Features:** Databaseless (flat-file), fast, Markdown support. It does mention "author" as a way to list content, suggesting some multi-user capability. Might be simpler if you want to avoid database management.
        * **Link:** [https://github.com/danpros/htmly](https://github.com/danpros/htmly)
    * **Chyrp Lite (`xenocrat/chyrp-lite` - though the official site is chyrplite.net)**:
        * **Features:** Lightweight, extensible ("Feathers" for post types). It's designed for flexibility.
        * **Link to an unofficial mirror or related repo might be on GitHub, official site:** [https://chyrplite.net/](https://chyrplite.net/) (Check GitHub for active forks if desired).
    * **WordPress (Self-hosted - wordpress.org)**:
        * While not a "builder" on GitHub in the sense of its core code (though parts and plugins are), WordPress is a highly mature PHP/MySQL based CMS that natively supports multiple users with different roles (including authors who can manage their own posts). It has built-in registration, and email confirmation can be managed through plugins or custom code. It's the most popular CMS globally. You'd download it from wordpress.org and host it yourself.

3.  **Blog Applications with Admin Panels (Often Educational or Portfolio Projects):**
    * These can be great for learning or as a starting point if you're willing to modify and extend them.
    * **`favourite-Coder/Blog-Application`**:
        * **Features mentioned:** CRUD blog with admin panel, user registration/login with access control.
        * **Link:** [https://github.com/favourite-Coder/Blog-Application](https://github.com/favourite-Coder/Blog-Application)
    * **`mahboube89/BlogProject-PHP`**:
        * **Features mentioned:** User authentication, blog post creation/management, categories.
        * **Link:** [https://github.com/mahboube89/BlogProject-PHP](https://github.com/mahboube89/BlogProject-PHP)

**What to look for when choosing:**

* **Features:** Does it explicitly state multi-user support, user registration, and mechanisms for individual blogs? Is email confirmation a feature or easily implementable?
* **Activity & Maintenance:** Check the dates of the last commits, open issues, and pull requests. An active project is more likely to be secure and up-to-date.
* **Popularity:** Stars and forks can be an indicator of community adoption and a wider pool of people who might have solved similar problems.
* **Technology Stack:**
    * **Framework vs. Plain PHP:** Projects built on frameworks (like Laravel or Symfony) often have better structure, security features, and are easier to maintain in the long run, but have a steeper learning curve if you're unfamiliar with the framework. Plain PHP projects might be easier to understand initially if your PHP skills are foundational.
    * **Database:** Most will use MySQL/MariaDB, which is standard.
* **Documentation:** Good documentation will make setup and customization much easier.
* **Licensing:** Ensure the license (e.g., MIT, GPL) is compatible with your intended use.

**Recommendations:**

* **If you want a ready-to-go or near-ready solution and are comfortable with a framework:** Look at projects like **`KapilTamang/multi-user-blogging-system` (Laravel)**. Laravel itself provides excellent tools for authentication, email, and database management.
* **If you prefer plain PHP or a less framework-heavy approach:** Investigate **`mindsparkist/Php-Mysql-FullStack---Multi-User-Blogging-Platform-with-SEO-`** or **`Tarunno/Blog-PHP`**, but carefully vet their security practices and completeness for production use.
* **If you want an established, highly extensible platform (and don't mind that it's a full CMS):** Self-hosted **WordPress** is a very strong contender. It handles all your core requirements (registration, email confirmation via plugins, individual user blogs via author roles) and has a massive ecosystem.
* **For a lightweight, potentially simpler option (especially if you like flat-file):** **HTMLy** or **Typecho** could be worth exploring, though you'll need to confirm how deeply their multi-user features align with your vision of "individual blogs."

When you find a promising repository, clone it, set it up in a local development environment, and thoroughly test its features against your requirements. Remember that security (password hashing, XSS prevention, SQL injection protection) is paramount, especially with user registration and content submission.

Good luck with your search!
